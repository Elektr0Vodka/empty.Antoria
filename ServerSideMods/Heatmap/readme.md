# DayZ Heatmap Generator

Based on the index included with [HeatMap](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2854246756).

A lightweight browser-based tool to generate interactive heatmaps from exported DayZ server/player data. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no backend required.

Originally, a very basic `index.html` was created by Affenb3rt. This project expands and updates it, adding additional functionality, improvements and Antoria.

The mod included is based on Affenb3rt's version with updated functions from NullWorld.

**Note:** The mod should only be run server-side, not client-side.

The `index.html` also works with **NullWorld_Heatmap**.

## Installing HeatMap.pbo as a Server Mod

The JSON files used by `index.html` are generated by the **HeatMap.pbo** server mod. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Download HeatMap.pbo**  
   Obtain the HeatMap.pbo mod (based on Affenb3rt and NullWorld updates) and place it in your server’s `@ServerSideMods/addons` folder.

2. **Add the server mod to your server startup**  
   Include the mod in your server launch parameters using the `-servermod=` argument. Example:  
```
-servermod=@ServerSideMods
```

3. **Start the server**  
When the server initializes, the mod automatically creates a folder for heatmap data in the server profile:  
```
<server profile path>/Heatmap/
```

4. **Generate JSON files**  
After each mission ends, the mod saves a JSON file in the Heatmap folder. Each file contains the current heatmap data, including:
- Player waypoints  
- Deaths  
- Storages  
- Zombies  

Filenames include the timestamp of the mission end, e.g.:  
```
2025_08_25_14_30_Heatmap.json
```

5. **Using the Heatmap Tool**  
- Open `index.html` in a modern browser.  
- **Download Base Map:** Use the **Download Base Map** button to save the raw map PNG of the selected map. The original filename is preserved.  
- Drag and drop the JSON files or select the Heatmap folder using the **Select Folder** button.  
- Adjust layers, intensity, and the time filter.  
- Merge the data and map into an image using the **Merge Data and Map** button.  

> **Note:** Only server-side generated JSON files are compatible. The mod must not be run client-side.

## Generate images from heatmap mod output

1. Download `index.html`.
2. Open it in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3. Drag and drop your exported DayZ JSON files from the Heatmap folder onto the page or use the **Select Folder** button.
4. Adjust layers, intensity, and the time filter.
5. Click **Merge Data and Map** to export a combined heatmap image.

## JSON File Structure

The tool expects JSON files containing some of the following fields:

- `m_WayPoints`
- `m_DeathPoints`
- `m_StoragePoints`
- `m_ZombiePoints`

Each dataset is optional and will only be loaded if present.

---

## Configure Tracking Times

You can adjust how frequently player positions are tracked by adding this in your `serverDZ.cfg`:
```
heatmapTickTime = 120;
heatmapTickTimeVehicle = 30;
```

- Times are in seconds.
- Different intervals can be specified for players in vehicles or on foot.
- Default values are 120s (on foot) and 30s (in vehicle).

---

## Development Notes

- All rendering is client-side; no server is required.
- Heatmap colors follow a blue → green → yellow → red gradient based on intensity.
- Deaths, storages, and zombies are displayed as markers, not blended heatmaps.
- To add more maps, extend the `mapImage` and `mapSize` dictionaries in the JavaScript file.
- The **Download Base Map** button saves the selected map as a PNG without any heatmap overlay; the original filename is preserved.
