Changes and Setup

    Mission Folder Renamed
    Renamed the mission folder to Empty.Antoria.
    (Adjust the 'empty' part to match what you have set in your command line/serverDZ.cfg. Renaming this part does not affect functionality as this mission file does not include any #includes.)

    CE Folder Split
    Split and renamed the ce folders into antoria_ce and mods_ce.
    Be careful not to overwrite your custom types! It's better to add your custom types file instead.

    Added 1.26 Items to Types
    The 1.26 items are added to types.xml. However, they are not spawning by default.
    You need to manually select which items spawn and where, as I didn't want to interfere with custom types.
    (For a full list, check the 1.26 added types.)
	The new gamedev infected are added to the City infected entry.

    New Spawns and Territories
        Boat Spawns: Added.
        Reindeer Territories: Added.
        Hare Territories: Added based on existing hen territories.
        Fox Territories: Added.

    New Events
        Police Van Events: Replaced vanilla police vehicles with police vans.
        Police Van Event: Added spawnpoints near police stations and all roadblocks.

    Fixed Economy and Init.c
        Fixed issues with cfgeconomycore.xml entries.
        Updated Init.c to override PlayerBase CreateCharacter, so players spawn with the character selected in the main menu rather than a random one.

Character Selection Guide

To spawn with your selected character, follow these steps:

    For New Characters
        Before connecting for the first time, create your desired character in the main menu.
        Connect to the server through the in-game browser.

    For Existing Characters
        If you have an existing character, you'll need to die (either get killed or commit suicide).
        Disconnect to the main menu, select and customize your new character, then reconnect to the server to spawn with the new character.
